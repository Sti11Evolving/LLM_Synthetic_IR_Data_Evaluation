Gardner, a developmental psychologist and Harvard University education professor, decades ago developed a theory that intelligence can be measured in many ways other than simple IQ tests. In his seminal 1983 book, Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences and his update, Multiple Intelligences: New Horizons, Gardner laid out the theory that paper-and-pencil IQ tests are not the best ways to measure intelligence, which can include spatial, interpersonal, existential, musical and, of course, bodily-kinesthetic intelligence.",2,
